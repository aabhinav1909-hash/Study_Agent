# 📄 AI PDF Query Assistant

An intelligent **PDF question-answering application** that allows users to chat with PDFs, extract insights, and navigate directly to relevant content with clickable, highlighted sources.

Built using **Streamlit, Groq LLMs, and vector search**, this project transforms static PDFs into interactive knowledge systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload a PDF
2. Text is extracted and split into chunks
3. Chunks are converted into embeddings
4. Stored in a FAISS vector database
5. User asks a question
6. Relevant chunks are retrieved
7. LLM generates an answer using context
8. Sources are displayed with page navigation
